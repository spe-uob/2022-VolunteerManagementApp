2022 | To/Fro - Volunteer Management App

## Project Description:

At the beginning of the pandemic, To/Fro was created during a hackathon to support the Knowle West Alliance's work. They were previously manually matching up volunteers with people who needed help (like dog walking, picking up prescriptions, food shopping), but taking inspiration from things like Deliveroo and Uber, an open source Django application was developed to streamline the process.
Since then, the process has been codified into an API with additional features such as allowing for 1:Many actions (for things like event support) as well as tracking referrals to GPs, Food Banks and more, which needn't go out to individual volunteers.
The focus of this project would be to create in Vue, a rounded Co-ordinator front-end that moves entirely away from the default Django admin dashboard. The main areas for learning would be interfacing with the API, learning about HCI, and effectively working on an existing product and repository. There is a prototype of one section of the dashboard, which can be used as a jumping off point, but the finished solution should refactor this into clean and reusable code to be used across the interface.
