<h2 id="1">Overview</h2>

We're working on a website that can be used by different communities to help self organise, keep track of need and effectively deploy help. We focus on building an intuitive front-end design and a system which all users can interact with.

The application uses a Django project integrated with a vue application.

<h2 id = "a">1.1 Gantt Chart</h2>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jk70c7Ysqay2RxTJ-WYFc619bPg-nvXDeJa_21MRxU/edit#gid=1962477973">Gantt Chart</a>

<h2 id="2">1.2 Deployment Instruction</h2>

<h3 id="3">1.2.1 Backend: (Using Docker) </h3> 

#### Install Docker: <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>

To get running locally and quickly, download docker, clone this repository, then start the applications using this command in the api directory:

    docker-compose up --build

Then run the following command in the home directoryï¼š

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f development.yml up --build
```

This downloads all required node modules for the vue app.

Restart the tofro-django container and get running!!

<h3 id="4"> 1.2.3 Frontend: </h3> 

Direct to the helloworldvue directory and run the following commands
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

<h2 id="5"> 1.3 Getting Running! </h2> 

To get the website running open the following url:
```
http://localhost:8000/
```


Login then direct to:
```
http://localhost:8000/index
```

This is where the Vue Application is rendered. Now all that is left is to enjoy!!!

<h2 id="6"> 1.4 Possible Issues & Bugs </h2>

<h2 id="7"> 1.6 UX design </h2> 
To design an interactive user interface we employed general UX design methods, such as Journey Mapping, listing user personas and requirements. We aim to follow a UX design pattern.

<h3 id="8"> 1.6.1 Requirements:</h3> 

- The site needs to be intuitive and easy to navigate/use for the coordinator
- The site needs to facilitate easy logging of new actions
- The site needs to facilitate easy matching between actions and eligible volunteers
- The site needs to facilitate efficient dealing of high priority actions
- The site needs to facilitate easy searching of actions,residents and volunteers


<h3 id="9"> 1.6.2 User Personas:</h3> 

| <div align="left" style="width:240px">User</div>         | Goal          | <div align="left" style="width:400px">Frustrations</div>   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----|
| Coordinator 	| To efficiently match requests and log new data     	| Confusing UI requiring a lot of clicks and long traversals through out the interface |
| Residents 	| To quickly and efficiently give required information to coordinator     	| Long,slow drawn out phone call|
| Volunteer  | Quick matching of volunteered action    | Overlooked action for long period of times |

<h2 id="12">1.7 Ethics</h2> 
In our group, we are committed to upholding ethical standards in everything we do. However, there are certain things that cannot be avoided. For example, if coordinators use this application, we need to know their email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, and personal information. To avoid concerns about privacy and security, obtaining ethical approval is crucial.
To provide a good user experience, we have established the following ethical principles:

We will prioritize the safety of our users.
We will respect the privacy of our users and will never use their data for any purpose other than the intended one.
We will listen to feedback and criticism from our users and will use it to improve our products and services.
By adhering to these principles, we hope to create a culture of respect that benefits everyone in our group.
