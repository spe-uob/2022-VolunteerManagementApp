<h2 id="1"> 1.1 Overview</h2>

We're working on a website that can be used by different communities to help self organise, keep track of need and effectively deploy help. We focus on building an intuitive front-end design and a system which all users can interact with.

The application uses a Django project integrated with a vue application.

<h2 id="2"> 1.2 Deployment Instruction</h2>

<h3 id="b"> 1.2.1  Backend: (Using Docker) </h3> 

#### Install Docker: https://www.docker.com

To get running locally and quickly, download docker, clone this repository, then start the applications using this command in the api directory:

    docker-compose up --build

Then run the following command in the home directoryï¼š
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f development.yml up --build
```

This downloads all required node modules for the vue app.

Restart the tofro-django container and get running!!

<h3 id="f"> 1.2.3 Frontend: </h3> 

Direct to the helloworldvue directory and run the following commands
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

<h2 id="3"> 1.3 Getting Running! </h2> 

To get the website running open the following url:
    http://localhost:8000/

Login then direct to:
    http://localhost:8000/index

This is where the Vue Application is rendered. Now all that is left is to enjoy!!!

If you have a windows machine and you are having issues with setup.sh then run the following commands in your terminal:

```
dos2unix setup.sh
dos2unix run.sh
dos2unix run-dev.sh
```
Ensure you execute all commands in the specified order

<h2 id="5"> 1.5 UX design </h2> 
To design an interactive user interface we employed general UX design methods, such as Journey Mapping, listing user personas and requirements. We aim to follow a UX design pattern.
